## Welcome to my blog! 
You should expect to find tales about game development, CTFs, web dev, and embedded systems.

My resume ([written entirely in markdown](/resume)) is available as a pdf [here.](/resume.pdf)

This blog is kept in a [github repo](https://github.com/camilomcatasus/zola_blog).
A github action creates a new [docker image](https://github.com/camilomcatasus/zola_blog/pkgs/container/zola_blog/339754933?tag=main).
[Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) running in docker compose on my VPS detects and deploys the new image.
This tech stack allows me to edit the blog from a git repo and any changes pushed to github will be reflected in the site, my little self hosted  CI/CD pipeline for a blog.
